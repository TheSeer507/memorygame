# memorygame
Final de Sistemas Informaticos III

This is a simple JS memory came using some cards and finding matching pairs.

I used Guillermo Mansilla files (https://github.com/gmansilla/memory) and added a 
login interface that it is displayed when playing the game this will be useful
if you want to record the interactions in a data base for score, time, etc.

I'll continue working on this to further optimize it, any comments are really appreciated.
